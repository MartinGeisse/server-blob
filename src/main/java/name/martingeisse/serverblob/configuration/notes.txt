Need a way to store the configuration. Need a way to distinguish
- editable configuration stored in a writable source with serializers and deserializers
	- any configuration, except noted below...
- non-editable configuration stored in a read-only source with deserializers only
	- configuration of the configuration store itself

v1:
- skip configuration of the configuration store
- the configuration store is JSON files on disk (read/write)
- provide ConfigurationStorage with implementation FileConfigurationStorage
- uses classes as storage keys, mapped to MyClassName.json

later:
- keep configuration store configuration in Java property files on the server
- keep everything else in the configuration store

or:
- keep cluster-joining information in Java property files or command-line parameters on the server
- keep everything else in a network database (MySQL, etcd, ...)
- TODO where to keep configuration database access configuration (e.g. etcd network address)
