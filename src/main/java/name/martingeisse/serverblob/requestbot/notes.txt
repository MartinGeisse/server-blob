send JSON "program" to the request bot
it will send requests (serial or in parallel, depending on the program)
with varying parameters (depending on the program)
the number of requests is specified statically or determined by the responses
	(e.g. less results than expected); discarding parallel requests "after"
	the end condition (Note: they might have caused side effects on the server)
responses get merged using a merge algorithm specified in the "program",
	e.g. concatenate response bodies byte-wise or character-wise
	e.g. concatenate JSON arrays, also wrapped arrays
	e.g. concatenate XML array-like structures
post-process partial or final response,
	e.g. remove JSON fields the caller doesn't need, to reduce size
