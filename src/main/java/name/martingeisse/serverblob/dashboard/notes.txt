Dashboard functionality:
- widgets to place on homepage of management console
- dashboard pages in general (outside of management console) -- if this is a good idea at all
	(needs some other authorization mechanism, but SSO support would be a good thing anyway)
- cronjobs to update data for dashboard widgets

NOT:
- alerts & metrics. This is a module by itself. But once it exists, dashboard widgets that
	*show* alerts & metrics would be useful.
